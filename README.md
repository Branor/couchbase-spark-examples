# Couchbase Spark Examples
In this repository you can find examples that use the
[Couchbase Spark Connector](https://github.com/couchbaselabs/couchbase-spark-connector).

You can run them in the IDE or from the command line, but make sure to have Couchbase running on localhost and you
have both the `default` and `beer-sample` bucket installed if you just want to run them without further modifications.

We only have a few in here for now, but are planning to extend them greatly in the near future. If you have awesome
examples to show just send in a PR (or help us fix bugs).
